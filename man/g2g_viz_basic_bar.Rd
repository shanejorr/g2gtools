\title{Create a basic vertical bar chart}
\usage{
g2g_viz_basic_bar(
  .data,
  x_var,
  y_var,
  text_var,
  text_offset,
  fill_color = "gray"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The data set to visualize.}

\item{x_var}{The column name, as a string, of the variable (categorical) on the x axis.}

\item{y_var}{The column name, as a string, of the variable (numeric) on the y axis.}

\item{text_var}{The column name, as a string, of the variable to show as text. This will be the same
number as the variable in \code{y_var}, but users may want to round it or convert it to a percentage.}

\item{text_offset}{Defined how many units the text should offset horizontally from the y variable.
Use negative numbers to show the text within the bar and positive numbers to place the text
above the bar.}

\item{fill_color}{The color, as a string or hex number, of the bars for the bar chart.}

\description{
Creates a vertical bar chart. This function can be used as-is, but is primarily used to build
more complex plots. For example, \code{g2g_viz_high_expectations()} relies on this function
to create the underlying bar charts.
